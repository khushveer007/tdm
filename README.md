### Multi Protocol
- **HTTP/HTTPS** 
    - Multi-connection chunked downloads
    - Automatic fallback to a single connection for unsupported servers

- **BitTorrent** (paste the url that downloads the .torrent file or the magnet link)
    - Torrent file links and magnet links support
    - Peer discovery and management
    - Seeding capabilities
    - Tracker support
    - DHT and PEX support

### Download Management
- Priority based download queueing system
- Pause, resume, cancel, and delete for all downloads
- Comprehensive download status tracking
- Interactive format and quality selection for YouTube downloads

### YouTube Downloads

Paste a YouTube link into the add download dialog and TDM will fetch the
available formats using `yt-dlp`. You can then pick the exact combination of
video quality and format before the download starts. If the format list cannot
be retrieved, the default `yt-dlp` behaviour is used.
